    story: `Imagine if every dollar knew its destination, its constraints, and its compliance status before it moved. Not after—before.

PayFlow isn't just faster payments. It's a fundamental reimagining of how value moves across borders. We embed the rules into the money itself.`,

    story: `Other solutions speed up the old system. We replaced it.

Traditional cross-border payments require 6-7 intermediaries, each adding delay and extracting fees. PayFlow requires zero. Compliance that takes 48 hours happens in 2 seconds. FX rates that can shift 3% during settlement are locked at initiation.

This isn't incremental improvement. This is infrastructure for the next century.`,

Now, the worlds are colliding. PayPal holds $1B in crypto. Visa settles in USDC. JPMorgan runs a private blockchain. The question isn't whether institutional finance goes on-chain—it's who builds the rails.`,

PayFlow isn't just about moving money faster. It's about building infrastructure that doesn't discriminate based on geography or account size. When compliance is automated and settlement is instant, the small player and the institution stand on equal ground.

We built this because the financial system should work for everyone, not just everyone who can afford the friction.`,
